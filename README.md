# About

This is a water demo created using OpenGL 3.3. In order to run this demo you
will need to have the `GL_ARB_shading_language_420pack` extension available
on your machine.

This water demo uses a scrolling displacement map texture to simulate the
movement of waves. The shader is also taking into account the refractive
effect that the water would have on the background texture (by default the
pebbles).
